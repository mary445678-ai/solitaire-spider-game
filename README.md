Spider Solitaire is a popular card game played with two decks of cards, for a total of 104. The goal is to create eight complete sequences of cards, from King down to Ace, within the tableau (the main playing area). Once a sequence is completed, it is moved to the foundation and removed from play. The game is won when all eight sequences are complete. 

Game layout

Tableau: The main playing area consists of ten columns of cards. The first four columns are dealt six cards each, and the remaining six columns receive five cards each. In all columns, only the top card is face up.
Stock pile: The remaining 50 cards are placed in a facedown pile.
Foundation: Eight empty spaces are designated for the completed King-to-Ace sequences.

How to play

Move cards: You can move a face-up card on top of another face-up card in the tableau if it is one rank higher. For example, you can place a 7 of Clubs on top of an 8 of any suit.
Move sequences: A sequence of cards that are all the same suit and in descending order can be moved as a single unit. This is crucial for clearing out space.
Reveal hidden cards: When you move a card that was previously on top of a face-down card, the hidden card is turned face up and becomes available for play.
Use empty columns: You can place any card or sequence into an empty tableau column, which is an important strategy for reorganizing cards.
Deal from the stock: When you run out of available moves on the tableau, you can deal a new row of ten cards from the stock pileâ€”one face-up card on each tableau column. This can only be done if every tableau column has at least one card.
Win the game: The game is won when all 104 cards have been used to form eight complete King-to-Ace sequences of the same suit and moved to the foundation. 

Difficulty levels

Spider Solitaire can be adjusted for difficulty based on the number of suits used: 
One suit (easy): Only one suit (usually spades) is used, making it easier to form runs.
Two suits (medium): The game is played with two suits, typically spades and hearts.
Four suits (hard): All four suits are used, which is the most challenging version of the game.
